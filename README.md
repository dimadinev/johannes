## A Gutenberg-first theme for WordPress.

![A screenshot of the Johannes theme, which features a logo and social menu in the header, a cover block, and then two columns in the footer.](https://cldup.com/9VcRmIDKmd.png "Johannes Screenshot")

This theme is an experiment. It uses the [new block syntax for WordPress themes](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/developers/themes/block-based-themes/). You can follow along with the progress of Gutenberg themes on [GitHub](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/18925).
